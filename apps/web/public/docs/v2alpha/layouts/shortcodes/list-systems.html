<!--
  The source data file that is used by this shortcode is `systems.yml`.

  Systems are grouped into three types of Categories:
  
  - focusareas
  - systems (System Types)
  - context

  Every Category has a number of Subcategories. For example, focusareas has
  governance and solutions, among others.

  This shortcode shows all Systems that are part of a Subcategory along with
  the System's value_plane_context and platform_context (which is retrieved from
  the {system}.yaml).

  The purpose of this Shortcode is for debugging purposes. For example, by adding it
  to Systems of Engagment, one can see that that page is bound to the "Workload Plane",
  but not every System that is a System of Engagement belongs to the Workload Plane.
