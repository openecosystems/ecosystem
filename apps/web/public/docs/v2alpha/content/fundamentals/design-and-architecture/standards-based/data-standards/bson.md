# Binary JSON (BSON)

`BSON` is a binary data interchange format with the same capabilities as [JSON](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/json). It originated at MongoDB.

`BSON` is more efficient to transmit than [JSON](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/json) because it is more compact. It is also cheaper in terms of system resources to parse and render `BSON`.
