# Base64

Base64 is a binary-to-text Encoding that represents binary data in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by 6-bit Base64 digits.

The advantage of this Encoding is that one can transmit any binary data as Plain Text that only uses the 7-bit ASCII characters at the cost of 33-37% overhead.
