# Structured Query Language (SQL)

`SQL` is a Query Language that is used for most Relational Databases. It assumes that data is structured in Tables that have Rows and Columns.

There are four types of `SQL` statements for each of the operations in "[CRUD](/fundamentals/glossary/crud)":

| [CRUD](/fundamentals/glossary/crud) | `SQL`  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ |
| Create                              | INSERT |
| Read                                | SELECT |
| Update                              | UPDATE |
| Delete                              | DELETE |

`SQL` statements generally consists of the following sections:

- **Operation**: One of the four operations above.
- **From**: What Database table is affected.
- **Where**: Predicates to filter the data.
- **Group by**: To aggregate data.
- **Sort**: To sort the data.
