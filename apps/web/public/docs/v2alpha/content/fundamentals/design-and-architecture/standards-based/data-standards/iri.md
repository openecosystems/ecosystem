# IRI

The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is an internet protocol standard that builds on the [URI](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/uri). It greatly expands the set of permitted characters. IRIs may contain most characters from the Universal Character Set. It can now contain accented characters, Chinese characters, and so on.
