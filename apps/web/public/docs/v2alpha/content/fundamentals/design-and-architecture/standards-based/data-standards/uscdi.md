# USCDI

`USCDI` as an acronym of `United States Core Data for Interoperability`. Basically it says that Health Care companies (in the broadest sense of the word) Must use [FHIR](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/fhir) as a standard to interchange [PHI](/fundamentals/glossary/phi). (Interchanging this data with other providers is mandatory).

Compliance is enforced by the ONC in the context of [HIPAA](/fundamentals/glossary/hipaa). Deviating from using [FHIR](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/fhir) is allowed for the following exceptions:

- Content and Manner Exception
- Preventing Harm Exception
- Privacy Exception
- Security Exception
- Infeasibility Exception
- Health IT Performance Exception
- Fees Exception
