# DMC

A `DMC` is a 2D Barcode. It can be distinguished from other barcodes by two black lines. If there is more data, this pattern will repeat itself (i.e.: there will be 4 concatenated squares each with two black lines).

These Barcodes have parity data in them that can be used to reconstruct missing data if part of the image is distorted.
