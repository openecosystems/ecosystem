# Swagger

Before 2015 `Swagger` was a specification that could be used to describe [REST](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/rest) APIs, but in 2015 it was "donated" to the `OpenAPI Initiative` and renamed to "[OpenAPI](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/openapi)".

The tooling around it, though, has not been donated, so the tooling is still called "Swagger".

Both the `OpenAPI Initiative` and `Swagger` are owned by Smartbear.
