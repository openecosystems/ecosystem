# Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR)

In 2016, the 'FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship' were published in Scientific Data. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasize machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. `FAIR` is an implementation of [GDocP](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/gdocp).

## Findable

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

## Accessible

Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including [authentication](/fundamentals/glossary/authentication) and [authorization](/fundamentals/glossary/authorization).

## Interoperable

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. This means that the (meta)data must be presented in a broadly applicable language or representation.

## Reusable

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.
