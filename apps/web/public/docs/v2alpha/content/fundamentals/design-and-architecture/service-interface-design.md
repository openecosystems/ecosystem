# Service Interface Design

When we define a [Service](/fundamentals/system-types/systems-of-engagement/services) as a [Contract](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/contract-based-design/), we define it based on several qualifiers:

meta-model, operational, contribution, analytical, observable and discoverable.

## Meta-Model Interface Design

Meta-model interfaces allow our architects and engineers to define contracts that support ontologically mapped concepts to entities

that support jurisdictional and cultural-dependent concerns. Meta-model interfaces allow System consumers to find related concepts,

and discover semantic relationships.

## Operational Interface Design

Operational interface design allows for [Consistent](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/service-interface-design/)

operational CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) transactions.

## Contribution Interface Design

Contribution interface design allows for deep extensibility by introducing strategic injection points into any System

## Analytical Interface Design

- Search, List, Analytics, Statistics, Get Connected Test Demographics, Top Daily Test
  - Data-Product Driven Design

## Observability Interface Design

- Logs, Metrics, Lineage (Traces)

## Discoverability Interface Design
