# Extensible Markup Language (XML)

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of [SGML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/sgml) that is completely described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic [SGML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/sgml) to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with [HTML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/html). XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability with both [SGML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/sgml) and [HTML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/html).
