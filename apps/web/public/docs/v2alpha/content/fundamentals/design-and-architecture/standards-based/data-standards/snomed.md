# Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED)

Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED).

Tries to classify everything. Specifically used to classify symptoms.

Where [ICD-10](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/icd-10) could specify "x-ray", SNOMED can also describe what body part.

Where SNOMED can describe everything, [ICD-10](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/icd-10) only describes symptoms. SNOMED is from the perspective of the medical professional, [ICD-10](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/icd-10) is from the perspective of [Billing](/fundamentals/glossary/billing) / Insurance Claims (and thus harder to understand by medical staff).
