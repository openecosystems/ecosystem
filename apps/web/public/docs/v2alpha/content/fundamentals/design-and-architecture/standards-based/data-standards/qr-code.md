# QR Code

A Quick Response Code, better known as a QR-Code, is a 2D Barcode. It can be distinguished from other barcodes by a number of small squares. If there is more data, there will be more of those small squares.

These Barcodes have parity data in them that can be used to reconstruct missing data if part of the image is distorted.
