# PDF

`PDF` is a `Portable Document Format`, which is created by Adobe. Two intrinsic qualities make this Message Format the de-facto format for transmitting documents:

- Files that are generated in this format are more or less Immutable.
- It provides [WYSIWYG](/fundamentals/glossary/wysiwyg) across platforms.

PDF can (probably) be used to meet [ALCOA Legible](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/alcoa/#legible) and [Part 11](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/part-11).

The "best" tool to open `PDF` files, is Adobe Acrobat, or Adobe Acrobat Reader, for obvious reasons. However, nowadays there are many more tools that can open and render `PDF` files just fine, among which various Browsers like Chrome.
