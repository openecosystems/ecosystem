# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

`UML` is a general-purpose modeling language for Software development that it is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

There are two aspects to `UML`:

1. There is the _notation_ (which is rather complicated), and
2. There is a common set of abstractions.

`UML` knows many types of diagrams, that are divided into two categories:

1. Those that describe _structure_, and
2. Those that describe _behavior_.
