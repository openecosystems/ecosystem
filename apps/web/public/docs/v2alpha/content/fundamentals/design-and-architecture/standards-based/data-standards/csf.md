# Component Story Format (CSF)

`CSF` is a framework that is used to structure and organize elements of User Interfaces. It is design to help developers and designers to break down different parts of a User Interface into discrete units called "components" that can be managed, implemented, and reused more easily.

`CSF` can also be used to created Mockups during the graphical design phase of an application. This not only will give a component the right look, but would also allow for some interaction with it. These very components could then also be used in the real applications **as they were designed**.
