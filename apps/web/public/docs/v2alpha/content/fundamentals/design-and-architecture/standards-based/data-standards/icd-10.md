# ICD-10

A standard [Code Set](/fundamentals/glossary/code-set) that is used all over the world so that medical terms mean the same things everywhere.

Where [SNOMED](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/snomed) can describe everything, `ICD-10` only describes symptoms. [SNOMED](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/snomed) is from the perspective of the medical professional, `ICD-10` is from the perspective of [Billing](/fundamentals/glossary/billing) / Insurance Claims (and thus harder to understand by medical staff).
