# Medical Device Single Audit Plan (MSDAP)

The `MDSAP` is a program that allows the conduct of a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer's quality management system that satisfies the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions.

`MDSAP` relates to [ISO 13485](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/iso-13485) and is required if an [SaaMD](/fundamentals/glossary/saamd) is marketed in Canada, Japan, and Australia, among others.

`MDSAP` is not required in the United States, though the FDA does acknowledge `MDSAP` [Audits](/fundamentals/glossary/auditing).

The equivalent to `MSDAP` for Europe are the [Medical Device Directives (MDD)](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/mdd), which are soon to be replaced by the [Medical Device Regulations (MDR)](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/mdr).
