# IPv6

Internet Protocol v6 (IPv6) is a full specification of how communication should work across networks.

The reason why this version was created, is because [IPv4](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/ipv4) was running out of IP addresses. `IPv6` should be able to give every square mm of the earth's surface a unique IP address.

A subset of this specification is `Addressing`. Specific to `IPv6` is that an address consists of `128` bits, typically written in the format `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`.
