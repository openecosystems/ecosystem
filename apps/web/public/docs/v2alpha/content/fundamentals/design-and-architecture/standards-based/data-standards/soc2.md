# Service Organization Control 2 (SOC2)

Information Security is a reason for concern for all organizations, including those that outsource key business operation to third-party vendors (e.g., SaaS, cloud-computing providers). Rightfully so, since mishandled data—especially by application and network security providers—can leave enterprises vulnerable to attacks, such as data theft, extortion and Malware installation.

`SOC2` is an [Auditing](/fundamentals/glossary/auditing) procedure that ensures your service providers securely manage your data to protect the interests of your organization and the privacy of its clients. For security-conscious businesses, `SOC2` compliance is a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider.
