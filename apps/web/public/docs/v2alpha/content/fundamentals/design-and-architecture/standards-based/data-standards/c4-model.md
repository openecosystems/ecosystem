# Context, Containers, Components, Code Model (C4 Model)

The `C4 Model` is a Lean graphical notation technique for modelling the Architecture of Software systems. It relies on other Modelling Techniques like [UML](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/uml) and [ERD](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/erd).

The 4 Cs stand for:

-   Context
-   Containers (not the Docker-thing, a.k.a. "Systems", but that doesn't start with a "C")
-   Components
-   Code

These are different diagrams that can be created in any order.
