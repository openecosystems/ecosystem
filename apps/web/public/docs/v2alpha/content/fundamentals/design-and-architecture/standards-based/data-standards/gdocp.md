# GDocP

Good documentation practices. To achieve robust decisions, the supporting data set needs to be reliable and complete. `GDocP` should be followed in order to ensure all records, both paper and electronic, allow the full reconstruction and traceability of [GxP](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/gxp) activities.

[ALCOA](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/alcoa) and [FAIR](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/fair) are implementations of `GDocP`.
