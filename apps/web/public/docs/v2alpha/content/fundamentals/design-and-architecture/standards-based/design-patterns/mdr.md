# Medical Device Regulations (MDR)

`MDR` will be Europe's equivalent of [MDSAP](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/mdsap), which will be required for [SaaMDs](/fundamentals/glossary/saamd) that are marketed in Europe. It will soon replace [MDD](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/mdd).
