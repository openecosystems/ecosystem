# Availability Zone

If a [Region](/fundamentals/glossary/region) has more than one datacenter, then every datacenter is an `Availability Zone`. Redundancy and [High Availability](/fundamentals/glossary/high-availability) can be achieved by deploying components in multiple `Availability Zones` at little cost (both economically as well as in terms of [Latency](/fundamentals/glossary/latency)).
