# Zero-Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA)

ZTNA is like [ZTA](/fundamentals/glossary/zero-trust-architecture), but then specific to networks.

`ZTNA` is implemented by:

-   Establishing strong identity verification
-   Validating device compliance prior to granting access
-   Ensure [Least Privilege](/fundamentals/glossary/least-privilege) access to only explicitly authorized resources.

`ZTNA` becomes more important in [Cloud](/fundamentals/glossary/cloud) Environments, and even more important in Multi-Cloud Environments.
