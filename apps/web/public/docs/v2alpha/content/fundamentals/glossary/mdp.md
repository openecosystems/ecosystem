# Message Delivery Pattern (MDP)

A Message Delivery Pattern (MDP) describes how reliable message delivery should be. Less reliable generally implies "faster" and "cheaper". More reliable generally implies "slower" and "expensive" (both in terms of [CAPEX](/fundamentals/glossary/capex) and [OPEX](/fundamentals/glossary/opex)).

There are three `MDPs`:

- [At Most Once](/fundamentals/glossary/at-most-once)
- [At Least Once](/fundamentals/glossary/at-least-once)
- [Exactly Once](/fundamentals/glossary/exactly-once)
