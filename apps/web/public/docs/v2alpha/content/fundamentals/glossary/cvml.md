# Computer Vision / Machine Learning (CVML)

Computer Vision / Machine Learning (CVML) is an interdisciplinary field that combines Computer Vision and [Machine Learning](/fundamentals/glossary/ai) techniques to enable computers to interpret, understand, and make decisions based on visual data.

Computer Vision is the subfield of [AI](/fundamentals/glossary/ai) that focuses on developing algorithms and systems that can process and understand visual information from the real world. It could be captured by device cameras or otherwise. It aims to replicate human perceptions by enabling machines to extract meaningful insights from images or videos. Computer Vision tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and more.

Machine Learning is another subset of [AI](/fundamentals/glossary/ai) that deals with the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning techniques are used in CVML to recognize patterns, features, and relationships in visual data.

Open Ecosystem employs both to accurately and reliably read the Test Results of [Test Kits](/connected-test/).
