  `Hashing` is an algorithm that can be used to calculate a number from a stream of data. If one would change even one `bit`, the algorithm would produce a different number. Another way to look at it is that `Hashing` is the ability to generate a `fingerprint` that is unique for every unique piece of data.

# Hashing

The art of generate a number that is unique, a.k.a., the `Hash` to the content of a stream of data. Another word for a `Hash` is a `Checksum`.

`Hashing` is an algorithm that can be used to calculate a number from a stream of data. If one would change even one `bit`, the algorithm would produce a different number. Another way to look at it is that `Hashing` is the ability to generate a `fingerprint` that is unique for every unique piece of data.

There is a number of `Hashing Algorithms`. The most common ones are:

- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA512
