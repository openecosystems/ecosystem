# Zero Trust Architecture

An IT security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter. No single specific technology is associated with zero trust architecture; it is a holistic approach to network security that incorporates several different principles and technologies.

ZTA describes an approach to the design and implementation of IT Systems. The main concept behind ZTA is "Never Trust, Always Verify", which means that devices and services should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a trusted Network, and even if they were previously verified.
