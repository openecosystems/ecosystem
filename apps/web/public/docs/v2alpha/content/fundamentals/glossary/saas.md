# Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a [Cloud](/fundamentals/glossary/cloud) computing model that provides software applications to users over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of downloading and installing the application on an individual's device, the software is used through a Web Browser that gives access to all its features. Gmail is a well-known SaaS solution, andOpen Ecosystem is one, too.
