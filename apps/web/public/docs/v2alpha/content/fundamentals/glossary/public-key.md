# Public Key

A `Public Key` is an [asymmetric](/fundamentals/glossary/asymmetric-encryption) [encryption key](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption-key) that can be freely distributed to:

- Assert the identity (See [Authentication](/fundamentals/glossary/authentication)) of the sender, who has the [Private Key](/fundamentals/glossary/private-key).
- [Encrypt](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption) data for the recipient, who is the only one who has the [Private Key](/fundamentals/glossary/private-key) to decrypt it.
- To assert that data has not been modified while it was transmitted, see [Integrity](/fundamentals/glossary/integrity).
