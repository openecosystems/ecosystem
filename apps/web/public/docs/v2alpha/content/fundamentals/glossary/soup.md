# Software of Unknown Provenance (SOUP)

When software is used in a [Medical Device](/fundamentals/glossary/saamd) (or as a Medical Device) Regulatory Requirements demand that the software follows the [SDLC](/fundamentals/glossary/sdlc/) guidelines that are described in [IEC 62304](/fundamentals/sdlc/iec-62304/). However, that software could also make use of other software components that were _not_ developed in compliance with [IEC 62304](/fundamentals/sdlc/iec-62304/). These components are called "SOUP Components".

Because SOUP has not been created in accordance with [IEC 62304](/fundamentals/sdlc/iec-62304/) it introduces extra [Risk](/fundamentals/glossary/risk/) that MUST be identified and mitigated.
