# Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)

`RBAC` is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control.

`RBAC` describes:

-   Which User has what `Role`
-   What `Role` has what `Permissions`

A User can only execute a certain operation if he has a `Role` that gives him `Permissions` to execute that operation.
