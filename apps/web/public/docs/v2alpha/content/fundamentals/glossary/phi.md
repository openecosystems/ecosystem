# Protected Health Information (PHI)

Protected Health Information (PHI) includes _all_ personal health information of an individual, including payment information and demographic information. It applies to oral, written, and electronic forms.

`PHI` is subject to even more stringent regulatory requirements than [PII](/fundamentals/glossary/pii), which are imposed by [HIPAA](/fundamentals/glossary/hipaa).

The [ONC](/fundamentals/glossary/onc) uses the term `Electronic Health Record (EHI)` which is very similar to `PHI` and subject to the same regulations.
