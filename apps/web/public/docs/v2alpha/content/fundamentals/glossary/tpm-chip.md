# TPM Chip

A `TPM Chip` is Hardware that is common in most mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops, and Desktops. It applies Cryptography to provide Secure authentication using other (and better) mechanisms than a username / password combination (which requires the credentials to be transported over a [Hostile Network](/fundamentals/glossary/hostile-network), which is inherently Insecure.

Windows 11 depends on a `TPM Chip` (version 2); without it it will not install.
