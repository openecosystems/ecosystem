# DNS filtering

`DNS filtering` is the process of using the Domain Name System to block malicious websites and filter out harmful or inappropriate content. This ensures that company data remains secure and allows companies to have control over what their employees can access on company-managed networks. `DNS filtering` is often part of a larger access control strategy.

`DNS filtering` could be easy to circumvent. Many devices allow for configuring additional [DNS servers](/fundamentals/glossary/dns-server). By simply adding some public ones, hostnames that couldn't be resolved by the corporate DNS Server (because DNS filtering was applied), can be resolved again.
