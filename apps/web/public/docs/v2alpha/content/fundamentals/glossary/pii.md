# Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.

In computer systems `PII` should be treated with extra care. Many regulatory requirements are enforced to ensure `PII` is protected.

In the healthcare industry `PII` is often called [PHI](/fundamentals/glossary/phi), where it also includes medical data.
