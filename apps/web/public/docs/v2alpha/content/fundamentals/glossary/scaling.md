# Performance

`Scaling` is the mechanism by which the number of Hardware or Software instances is increased or decreased. This can be done manually or automatically.

If the load increases, [Performance](/fundamentals/glossary/performance) can be retained by `Scaling` up.  
If the load decreases cost can be reduced by `Scaling` down.

Whether a component can be `Scaled` depends on the behavior of the component: if the component has to be scaled more than twice if the load doubles, the component cannot be `Scaled`. The [Big O Notation](/fundamentals/glossary/big-o-notation) is a means of describing this behavior.

[[Scaling]] can be done Horizontally, Vertically, or both.
