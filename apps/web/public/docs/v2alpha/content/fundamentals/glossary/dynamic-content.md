# dynamic content

Dynamic content is website content that has to be fetched from the origin server, because the content has a time dependency.

I.e.: A specific website could show you your orders. This website must be retrieved from the origin server to be accurate, because if you placed an order after the last time you looked at your orders, the content will be different.
