# Pull Request

A `Pull Request` is a common model where a set of code changes can be presented to other developers for review, along with a description. If the reviewer approves the code changes, they can be merged into the main branch.

[CI Pipelines](/fundamentals/glossary/ci-cd) can assist in checking the quality of the submitted code.
