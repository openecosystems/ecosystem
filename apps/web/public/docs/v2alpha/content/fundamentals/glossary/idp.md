    An identity provider (IdP or IDP) stores and manages users' digital identities. Think of an IdP as being like a guest list, but for digital and cloud-hosted applications instead of an event. An IdP may check user identities via username-password combinations and other factors, or it may simply provide a list of user identities that another service provider (like an [SSO](/fundamentals/glossary/#sso)) checks.
