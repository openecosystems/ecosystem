# Idempotence

Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby those operations can be applied multiple times, without changing the result.

I.e.:

- The operation "Create a file with the content 'Hello World'" is idempotent.
- "Write 'Hello World' to an existing file" is not.
