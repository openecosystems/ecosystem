# Service Mesh

A `Service Mesh` is a dedicated infrastructure layer that you can add to your Applications. It allows you to transparently add capabilities like observability, traffic management, and security, without adding them to your own code.

It is a core component of the [Micro Services Architecture](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/design-patterns/micro-services-architecture).

There is a number of Service Mesh implementations, among which:

-   [Control Plane](https://controlplane.com/)
-   [Istio](https://istio.io/)
-   [Open Service Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Service_Mesh)
