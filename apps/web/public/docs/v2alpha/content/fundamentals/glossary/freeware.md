# Freeware

Some Software products are "free" to use, like Adobe Acrobat Reader, or Apache HTTP Server.

Not everything that is `Freeware` is also [Open Source](/fundamentals/glossary/open-source). I.e. `Apache HTTP Server` is [Open Source](/fundamentals/glossary/open-source), where `Adobe Acrobat Reader` is not.

Not everything that is `Freeware` is actually free. Especially as an enterprise like Open Ecosystems one should be **very careful** before one decides to use `Freeware`, even Open Source `Freeware`. The most important reason is that `Freeware` comes with a [Software License](/fundamentals/glossary/software-license). Some of them require you to make your code [Open Source](/fundamentals/glossary/open-source) as well, if you decide to use the [Open Source](/fundamentals/glossary/open-source) product. Depending on the use case that could prove detrimental for the company.
