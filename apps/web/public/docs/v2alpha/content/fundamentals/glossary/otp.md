# One-Time Password (OTP)

`OTP` stands for one-time-password, which is a temporary verification code usually transmitted via SMS or email. `OTPs` remain active within a short period. The user will have to request another `OTP` if they are unable to use it within the set time frame.

`OTPs` need to be sent to the User using a different medium that only that User has access to. Typically this means Email or SMS.

Something is as Secure as its weakest link. So by sending the `OTP` to a User's Email Address makes it as Secure as the protection of his Email account, which may be a simple Username / [Password](/fundamentals/glossary/2fa/#password) combination.

SMS is typically more Secure, as an SMS is bound to a phone number, and a phone number is usually bound to a specific device by the SIM Card. It's pretty hard to spoof a phone number.

In modern times of VoIP phone numbers are no longer always bound to SIM Cards, and thus no longer explicitly bound to a single device. Some service providers, therefore, only allow the registration of phone numbers that are bound to a SIM Card.
