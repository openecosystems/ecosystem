# Disaster Recovery

`Disaster Recovery` is the process of maintaining or reestablishing vital infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced [Disaster](/fundamentals/glossary/disaster), such as a storm or a battle.

Some important Non-Functional Requirements that apply to `Disaster Recovery`:

-   [RTO](/fundamentals/glossary/rto)
-   [RPO](/fundamentals/glossary/rpo)
-   [MTTR](/fundamentals/glossary/mttr)

For any system objectives for these requirements should be defined twice: once in case there is a [Failure](/fundamentals/glossary/failure) and once in case there is a [Disaster](/fundamentals/glossary/disaster).
