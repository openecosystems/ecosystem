# Vaporware

Vaporware is a product, typically Hardware or Software, that is announced to the general public, but is late or never actually released. They are solutions that look good on paper, but in the end are empty promises, because it is simply too good to be true.

In business there is a delicate balance between advertising something's best features and greatest potential and making promises one knows one cannot keep. That line must never be crossed.
