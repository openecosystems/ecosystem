  Each device connected to the [Internet](/fundamentals/glossary/internet) has a unique [IP Address](/fundamentals/glossary/ip-address) which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in [IPv4](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/ipv4)), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2001:db8::1:1:1:1 (in [IPv6](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/ipv6)).
