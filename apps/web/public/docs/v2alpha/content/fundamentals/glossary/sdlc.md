# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC is a set of processes and procedures that describe how software is developed and maintained through its entire life cycle, from its conception unto its retirement.

It encompasses many aspects, among which:

- Business Requirements
- Technical Requirements
- Architecture Designs
- Detailed Level Designs
- Testing
- Maintenance
- Operations
- Risk Management
- Configuration Management

Open Ecosystem's SDLC is described in [Fundamentals/SDLC](/fundamentals/sdlc/).

When software is used in or as a [Medical Device](/fundamentals/platform/medical-device/), Regulatory Requirements demand adherence to the SDLC that is described in [IEC 62304](/fundamentals/sdlc/iec-62304/).
