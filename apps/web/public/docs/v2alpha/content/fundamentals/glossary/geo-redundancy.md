# Geo-Redundancy

The act of storing data in multiple physical locations, so that in case of a [Failure](/fundamentals/glossary/failure) or [Disaster](/fundamentals/glossary/disaster) in one geographical region the data can still be retrieved from another location.

How much data loss is acceptable is described as the [RPO](/fundamentals/glossary/rpo).  
How long it may take for data to become available again is described as the [RTO](/fundamentals/glossary/rto).
