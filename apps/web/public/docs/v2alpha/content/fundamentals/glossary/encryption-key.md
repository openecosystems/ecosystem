# Encryption Key

An `Encryption Key` can be used to [Encrypt](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption) and Decrypt data. Depending on whether Encryption is [Symmetric](/fundamentals/glossary/symmetric-encryption) or [Asymmetric](/fundamentals/glossary/asymmetric-encryption) the `Encryption Key` would consist of one or two keys, respectively.

If one would do [Envelope Encryption](/fundamentals/glossary/envelope-encryption), one would have a [Key Ring](/fundamentals/glossary/key-ring) instead of a single `Encryption Key`.
