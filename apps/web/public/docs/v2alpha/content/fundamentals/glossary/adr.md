# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

During the Architecture Design phase of the [SDLC](/fundamentals/glossary/sdlc) each Architectural Decision is meticulously recorded in an `ADR`.These ADRs serve as a safeguard to ensure that the Architectural Design remains free from unverified assumptions. This proactive approach prevents situations where, at a later stage in the process, it becomes apparent that the design cannot be feasibly implemented.

It contains the following sections:

-   Problem Description
-   Possible Solutions
-   Chosen Solution
-   Evidence

Evidence can be presented in various forms. They can be the outcome of Research, results of a Spike, or a working Proof of Concept (PoC).
