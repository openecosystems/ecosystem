# Key Ring

A `Key Ring` is a collection of [Encryption Keys](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption-key) that can be used to [Decrypt](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption) data using [Envelope Encryption](/fundamentals/glossary/envelope-encryption).

AWS has two types of Key Rings:

-   A normal `Key Ring`, and a
-   Multi-[Region](/fundamentals/glossary/region) `Key Ring`.

The first is cheaper, but not [Disaster Proof](/fundamentals/glossary/disaster-recovery); the second one is more Expensive, but survives Disasters.
