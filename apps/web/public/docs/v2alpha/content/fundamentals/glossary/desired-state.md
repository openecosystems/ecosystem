# Desired State

## Infrastructure as Code

In the context of [Infrastructure as Code](/fundamentals/glossary/infrastructure-as-code) a `Desired State` is a declaration of what an infrastructure should look like.

An [Infrastructure as Code](/fundamentals/glossary/infrastructure-as-code) implementation could then compare the `Desired State` to the [Current State](/fundamentals/glossary/current-state) to determine what changes need to be made in order to get from the [Current State](/fundamentals/glossary/current-state) to the `Desired State`; by executing those actions the [Current State](/fundamentals/glossary/current-state) becomes identical to the `Desired State`.

## Other applications

The mechanism of defining a `Desired State`, determining the [Current State](/fundamentals/glossary/current-state), and then identifying actions to make the [Current State](/fundamentals/glossary/current-state) identical to the `Desired State` can basically be applied to anything, including realizing a (long term) vision, for example.
