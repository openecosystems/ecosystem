# Private Key

A `Private Key` is an [asymmetric](/fundamentals/glossary/asymmetric-encryption) [encryption key](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption-key) that Must be kept private. It can be used for:

-   Providing evidence of one's identity, because you're the only one with the `Private Key` that can [encrypt](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption) data that can only be decrypted with the [Public Key](/fundamentals/glossary/public-key) (see [Authentication](/fundamentals/glossary/authentication).
-   To decrypt information that was intended for you only, see [Encryption](/fundamentals/glossary/encryption).
-   To provide a means for the recipient to verify that the data that you sent has not been modified during transport, see [Integrity](/fundamentals/glossary/integrity).
