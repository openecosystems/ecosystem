# Application Program Interface (API)

An API is a declaration of how computers or computer programs should exchange information. It can be seen as a contract between two Services.

## API Standards

There are three main API standards:

- [SOAP](/fundamentals/glossary/soap): the old one.
- [REST API](/fundamentals/glossary/rest-api): the current, lighter, and simpler one.
- [gRPC](/fundamentals/design-and-architecture/standards-based/data-standards/grpc): the faster
