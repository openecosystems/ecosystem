# FQDN

`Fully Qualified Domain Name`, a Domain Name that can be resolved both from within a Local Area Network an from the [Internet](/fundamentals/glossary/internet).

An `FQDN` consist of a Domain Name and `Top Level Domain`. `Top Level Domains` include `.com`, `.gov`, and `info`, for example, or abbreviations of names of countries like `.nl` (the Netherlands) and `.de` (Germany, or Deutschland).

`FQDNs` can also be used to resolve hostnames within a private network, to route between different Local Area Networks, for example. In that case the `Top Level Domain` should NOT be identical to one of the public ones. Common choices are `.local`, `.intranet`, and `.mycompany` for example.
