# Open Economic Systems (Open Ecosystems)

Open Economic Systems is an open-source platform designed to securely transport, manage, and exchange health, financial, and lifestyle data between multiple mutually distrusting parties—without requiring open ports or changes to firewall rules. Built against our operational governance framework tailored for trustless environments, the platform ensures secure collaboration and data integrity. While the project is still in its early stages and does not yet have a website, we aim to bring together leading organizations in healthcare and finance to establish a thriving community.

Key use cases Open Economic Systems will support include:
- Federated Machine Learning: Train models on datasets you don’t control without compromising privacy.
- Privacy-Preserving Statistics: Generate insights from third-party data without ever accessing the raw data.
- Advanced Analytics: Leverage our cryptographic data mesh for deep analytics without moving data.
- Secure Data Queries: Perform direct queries on sensitive systems like FHIR and DICOM without requiring open ports or new firewall rules.
- Streamlined Inter-Hospital Communication: Eliminate the need for faxing data between hospitals lacking VPN connections.
